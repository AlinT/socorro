This directory is for the auto discovery middleware services.  Any file 
with a name ending in the string "service.py” will be considered as a 
source for a middleware service.  The auto discovery mechanism will 
look into each of the aforementioned files for classes that have names 
ending with “Service”.  The mechanism will attempt to load these 
classes automatically as middleware services.
